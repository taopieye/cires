Code submission for CIRES Earth Lab. This code is based off of my experience at work, doing kaggle competitions, watching Google I/O videos, and reading Francios Chollet's Deep Learning for Python book. 

In my current capacity as a research scientist, I don't always work with image data. However, I do plenty of work with dimensionality reduction and feature engineering. Due to the proprietary nature of my work with Lockheed, I was not able to provide a clear example of the kind of data I get to play with on a daily basis. I hope this submission suffices to demonstrate my skill set.
